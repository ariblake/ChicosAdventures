# Chico's Adventures Website
This is a website redesign for the author of a book series: Chico's Adventures for Kids. The client wanted to revamp their outdated website to make it a place that both children and parents could visit to learn more about the books, learn about the authorâ€™s inspiring backstory, and purchase the books or donate.

This project was chosen as the winner for the #1 branding and website for Chico's Adventures among the college.
